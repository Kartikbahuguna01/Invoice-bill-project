    <p>Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. It was here where Starbucks <br> opened its first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices from around the world for our customers to take home.<br> Our name was inspired by the classic tale, “Moby-Dick,” evoking the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.</p>

    <h1 style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: 1000;margin-top:40px;">Coffe & Craft</h1>
    <p>It takes many hands to craft the perfect cup of coffee – from the farmers who tend to the red-ripe coffee cherries, <br> to the master roasters who coax the best from every bean, and to the barista who serves it with care. We are committed <br> to the highest standards of quality and service, embracing our heritage while innovating to create new experiences to savor.</p>

    <p>We like to say that we are not in the coffee business serving people, but in the people business serving coffee. Our employees <br> – who we call partners – are at the heart of the Starbucks experience. We are committed to making our partners proud and <br> investing in their health, well-being and success and to creating a culture of belonging where everyone is welcome.</p>

    <p>As it has been from the beginning, our purpose goes far beyond profit. We believe Starbucks can, and should, have <br> a positive impact on the communities we serve.</p>
